In Rails, an association is a connection between two Active Record models. 

Why do we need associations between models? 
Because they make common operations simpler and easier in your code.



has_many :

one-to-many relationship:

use has_many macro in parent 
use belongs_to in child model

each instance of parent model has zero or more instances of another model
